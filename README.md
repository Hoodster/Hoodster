## Who am I?

I'm Jakub but friends (and others) call me Kuba. My routine is working as a fullstack software developer. I am Bachelor of Computer Science graduate in Silesian University of Technology (SDG ranking 801-1000).

## But Kuba, what can we find here?
Well, mostly I use GitHub for university stuff. Don't get me wrong. Most of it is horribly written and kills all good practices (does ✨Macro Assembly x64✨ have good practices at all?). So please don't expect beautiful coding experience at my best. My valuable code (**all these projects I thought I will turn into money one day**) is often set private or I have it on another platform.

Yeah... I need to cleanup here definitely.

## Ok ok, so what technologies are you in? Apart from Macro Assembly 🔥 of course 🔥.
- C# and .NET from version Core 2.1 to .NET 5 (still learning .NET 6)
- JavaScript ES5 and higher
- React.js
- many smaller things that comes along with these 3 above
- Docker
- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server) and NOSQL databases (especially MongoDB & Firebase)
