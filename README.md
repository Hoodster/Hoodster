## Who am I?

I'm Jakub but friends (and others) call me Kuba. My routine is working as a fullstack software developer. I am Bachelor of Computer Science graduate in Silesian University of Technology (SDG ranking 801-1000).

## But Kuba, what can we find here?
Well, mostly I use GitHub for university stuff. Don't get me wrong. Most of it is horribly written and kills all good practices. So please don't expect beautiful coding experience at my best. My valuable code (**all these projects I thought I will turn into money one day**) is often set private or I have it on another platform.

Yeah... definitely I need to cleanup here.

## Stack
- C# and .NET from version Core 2.1 to .NET 7
- JavaScript/TypeScipt ES5 and higher
- React.js
- many smaller things that come along with these 3 above
- Docker
- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, Postgress) and NoSQL databases (especially MongoDB & Firebase)

## Assuming I want to contact with you...
