## Who am I?

I'm Jakub but friends (and others) call me Kuba. My routine is working as a fullstack software developer from Monday to Friday. On weekends I usually <del>do nothing and rest</del> study Computer Science at The Silesian University of Technology.

## But Kuba, what can we find here?
Well, mostly I use GitHub for university stuff. Don't get me wrong. Most of it is horrible written and kills all good practices (do âœ¨Macro Assembly x64âœ¨ HAS a good practices at all?). So please don't expect beautiful coding experience at my best. My VaLuAbLe code (**all these projects I thought I will turn into money one day**) is often set private or I have it on another platform.

Yeah... I need to cleanup here definitely.

## Ok ok, so what technologies are you in? Apart from Macro Assembly ðŸ”¥ of course ðŸ”¥.
- C# and .NET from version Core 2.1 to .NET 5 (still learning .NET 6)
- JavaScript ES5 and higher
- React.js
- many smaller things that comes along with these 3 above
